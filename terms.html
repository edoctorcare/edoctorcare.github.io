<br>(Patients)
<br>Last Updated: March 10, 2021
<br><br>THIS PLATFORM SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, PLEASE CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY OR VISIT THE NEAREST EMERGENCY CENTRE.
<br>
<br>LEGAL AGREEMENT:
<br>eDoctorcare services that we may make available to you through or in connection with the application of telemedicine services (hereinafter referred to as “Telemedicine”) are owned and operated by eDoctorcare (RTawfik MPC)
<br>By accessing and using the Telemedicine, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (these “Terms”), which establish a contractual relationship between you and eDoctorcare and constitute a legal agreement. If you do not agree to these Terms at any point, you must immediately cease accessing and using Telemedicine.
<br>By registering for, and participating in an Telemedicine, YOU understand and agree that:
<br>While the healthcare provider will attempt to respond in a timely fashion to YOUR visit request, there is no guarantee that all electronic communications will be reviewed and/or responded to within any specific period of time.
<br>
<br>
<br>YOU are responsible for following up on the healthcare provider’s electronic communication.
<br>
<br>
<br>YOU will review electronic communications for completeness before submitting.
<br>
<br>
<br>YOU will communicate any changes in YOUR contact information to the healthcare provider.
<br>
<br>
<br>The healthcare provider is not responsible for information loss due to technical failures associated with the Services or internet service provider.
<br>
<br>
<br>YOUR healthcare provider will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of information sent and received using the eDoctorcare services.
<br>
<br>
<br>However, there are risks in using any electronic communication systems and the healthcare provider cannot guarantee the security and confidentiality of electronic communication.
<br>
<br>
<br>YOU acknowledge and understand that despite encryption software and other privacy/security safeguards being used for electronic communications, it is possible that communications with YOUR doctor or their staff using the eervices during this project may not be completely secure. Despite this, YOU agree to communicate with YOUR doctor, other health care providers and/or their staff using these services with a full understanding of the risk and for the avoidance of doubt explicitly agree that email is a satisfactory form of communication in relation to carrying out the services.
<br>
<br>
<br>SECURE MESSAGING
<br>Telemedicine is conducted through a secure platform via video or audio. Text messaging is not a feature we currently support.
<br>
<br>MOBILE APP
<br>Our services may be accessed through a mobile phone, personal digital assistant or other wireless device running iOS or Android operating system. If services are accessed through a mobile device, YOU will ensure that YOUR mobile device is secure to ensure YOUR privacy. Any pictures taken on a mobile device to be uploaded to the Services may be stored on the mobile device, and it is YOUR responsibility to ensure the privacy and security of those images.
<br>
<br>HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS 
<br>All healthcare providers providing healthcare services are independent, regulated health professionals registered to practice medicine in a Province or Territory of Ontario, Canada. eDoctorcare is not a healthcare provider. Healthcare providers alone are responsible for the healthcare services they provide through Telemedicine.
<br>If you want information about any particular healthcare providers please consult his or her profile on the register on the website of the medical regulator (in most Provinces, the “College of Physicians and Surgeons”, “College of Nurses”, etc., of the Province), in the Province or Territory in which the healthcare provider practices.
<br>
<br>HEALTHCARE SERVICES
<br>Telemedicine enables you to access the online provision of health care from healthcare providers who practice in Ontario. Telemedicine and healthcare services will only be made available to you if you are ordinarily resident in Ontario and physically in the province at the time that you request healthcare services. By using Telemedicine and healthcare services, you represent and warrant that you meet the residency requirements set out above at the time that the healthcare services are provided. You agree that Telemedicine is made available solely for your personal and non-commercial use.
<br>

<br>
<br>BY REGISTERING TO USE THE eDOCTORCARE PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT:
<br>eDoctorcare is not a party to the relationship between you and any healthcare provider providing healthcare services. Healthcare providers are independent contractors who are not employed by eDoctorcare.
<br>
<br>HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO YOU, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS OF CARE AND RECORD-KEEPING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS.
<br>As with any other medical consultation, no results can be guaranteed or assured: your healthcare provider may determine that healthcare services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide healthcare services to you through Telemedicine.
<br>As with any other health care service, there are risks associated with the use of the healthcare services.
<br>
<br>Telemedicine may not permit the transmission of information in a way that allows the healthcare provider to provide healthcare services (e.g., poor resolution of images).
<br>You are responsible for providing the healthcare provider with the information that he or she advises is required in order to provide you with healthcare services.
<br>The laws that protect the privacy and security of Personal Information apply to telemedicine;
<br>
